- Easy to maintain

### For Long-Term Investment (3+ months available)
**Use React Native**
- Better performance
- More native feel
- Larger ecosystem
- Better for future features

## Implementation Recommendation

**Phase 1: Quick Win (Week 1-2)**
1. Implement as PWA for Android users
2. Deploy to web hosting
3. Gather user feedback

**Phase 2: iOS Support (Week 3-4)**
1. Add Capacitor
2. Integrate Bluetooth LE plugin
3. Submit to both app stores

**Phase 3: Optimization (Month 2-3, if needed)**
1. Evaluate user adoption
2. If significant traction, consider React Native rewrite
3. If limited adoption, stick with Capacitor

This staged approach minimizes initial investment while keeping options open for future enhancement.
